## Overview

Language Translator is a web application that allows users to translate text from one language to another. It supports manual translation using a convenient user interface with language selection and a "Translate" button. Additionally, the application features an auto-translate mode, enabling real-time translation as users type.

## Features

- **Manual Translation:** Users can enter text, choose the source and target languages, and click the "Translate" button to get the translation.

- **Auto-Translate Mode:** Enable or disable auto-translate mode with a toggle button. In auto-translate mode, the translation updates dynamically as users type.

- **Copy to Clipboard:** Users can easily copy the translated text to their clipboard by clicking the clipboard icon.

- **Visual Feedback:** A subtle toast notification appears when the text is copied to provide a visual confirmation.
